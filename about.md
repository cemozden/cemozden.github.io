Hi! My name is Cem (The pronunciation of my name is pretty much similar to the English word "**Jam**" and yes, my name sounds like a food (: ). I’m a simple man who has been living in Kraków, Poland since Jan 2019. I’ve been working as an IT Engineer, mainly working on software development and system analysis of our project. I’m currently employed as Full-Stack Software Engineer by [VirtusLab](https://www.virtuslab.com/). I used to work for [Luxoft](https://www.luxoft.com/), working (outsourcing) for [UBS](https://www.ubs.com/) and [Halkbank](https://www.halkbank.com.tr/).

My major focus on IT is regarding Software Development, Performance measuring, System Clusters, Memory Databases, DevOps Tech-Stack as well as Software Planning. To achieve my goals for the above fields, I prefer languages such as Rust, C++, JavaScript (NodeJS), TypeScript, Java, and PowerShell. My development environment is accumulated over Ubuntu 20.04 Linux Environment. Recently, I’ve been researching fields such as Big Data and Distributed software systems around data centers.
