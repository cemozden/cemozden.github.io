Hi! My name is Cem (The pronunciation of my name is pretty much similar to the English word "**Gem**" ). I’m a simple man who has been living in Copenhagen, Denmark since Jan 2022.

I’ve been working as an IT/Software Engineer, mainly working on software development and system analysis of various projects. I’m currently employed as a Backend Engineer by [The Org](https://theorg.com/). Before living in Denmark, I used to work for [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com), working (outsourcing) to [Tesco](https://tesco.com), [Luxoft](https://www.luxoft.com/), working (outsourcing) to [UBS](https://www.ubs.com/) in Poland and [Halkbank](https://www.halkbank.com.tr/) in Turkey.

My major focus on IT is regarding Software Development, Performance measuring, System Clusters, Memory Databases, DevOps Tech-Stack as well as Software Planning. To achieve my goals for the above fields, I prefer programming languages such as Scala, Rust, C++, Java, and Shellscript with development environment accumulated over Arch Linux Environment. Recently, I’ve been researching on fields such as Big Data and Distributed software systems around data centers.
